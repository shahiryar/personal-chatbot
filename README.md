# personal-chatbot
creating a personal chatbot from a given context using QA models from huggingface.
The idea is to load a QA model, fine tune it on SQUAD dataset, and then provide it with context about my professional information. Then the assumption is that the model with be able to process questions similar to the context and be able to provide responses. Effectively acting as a chat bot for my personal website.
